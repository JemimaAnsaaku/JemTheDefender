# Offensive Security 
## Objective
Offensive security encourages us to outsmart hackers by using their tactics to enhance our own defence systems. By learning specific techniques like exploiting software bugs, breaking into computer systems and finding loopholes we can identify weaknesses in softwares to prevent a hacker from doing the same. 
## Tools Used 
Gobuster - A command-line application which works by taking a wordlist and brute forcing them onto the target URL to identify in any pages or directories exist. 
Command-line interface - A text-based interface where commands are input to interact with the operating system and perform tasks (similar to visual buttons), only they are more accurate and efficient to use
