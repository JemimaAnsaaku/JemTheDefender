# Why I chose the PreSecurity room #
I chose the PreSecurity room as it was the perfect entry point into the industry of Cybersecurity and would give me a very solid introduction into the specialised mechanisms involved in offensive and defensive security methods. With my background in Forensic Psychology, we were often encouraged to think from the perspective of a criminal and I have found my calling in fighting crime through technology. I have observed the parrallels between intercepting criminal behaviour as a Fraud Protection Advisor and identifying weaknesses in systems, and I believe this room was essential in obtaining the foundational knowledge necessary to thrive in this field. 

## Offensive or Defensive üßê ##
Through TryHackMe's PreSecurity room, I hope learn the fundamentals of both a red team (ethical hacking, penetration testing) and blue team (threat intelligence, malware analysis, SIEM) testing. I believe a well-rounded skill set in knowling how to protect against cyber criminals in addition to thinking like them will amplify my abilities as a cybersecurity analyst.
