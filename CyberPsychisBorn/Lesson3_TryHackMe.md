Pentesting or ethical hacking. The role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company by uncovering laws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking to evaluate risk in each instance. 

### Red Teamer
Red teamers and Penetration testers share similarities however red teamers have a more specific role role. Whilst penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence sharp, red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This role consists of enacting a cyber criminal's actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month typically by a team external to the company.
