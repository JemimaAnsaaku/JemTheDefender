# And now introducing...

The match of my interest for cybersecurity was sparked in an unexpected place: as a Fraud Prevention Advisor. At TSB bank, I wasn't building systems or running networks, but I was 
something akin to a human firewall. When clients called in with blocked accounts, I was to verify their identities by analysing their transaction history, carefully navigate Power
of Attorney relationships and use my contextual hunches to intercept scammers in their pursuit of accessing financial information. It was here where I realised that an organised 
hierachical system of collobarating teams is essential in securing the digital world digital criminals. This never-ending war is often overlooked and underrated. 

At the time I didn't realise it, but during my MSc in Forensic Psychology, i was applying the same analytical mindset within my research and statistic modules. I had learned to analyse human behaviour, predict actions and assess risk. The general theme here was spotting anomalies, and I believe this directly translates into field. As I seek futher educative resources into cybersecurity, I begin to understand much of it is rooted in data analysis and the importance of taking swift action against threats and weaknesses in software.
