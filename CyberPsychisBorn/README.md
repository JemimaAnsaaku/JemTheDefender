# And now introducing...

The match of my interest for cybersecrity was sparked in an unexpected place: as a Fraud Prevention Advisor. At TSB bank, I wasn't building systems or running networks, but I was 
something akin to a human firewall. When clients called in with blocked accounts, I verified their identities, analysed their banking patterns, carefully navigated Power of Attorney relationships and used my critical hunch to intercept scammers in their pursuit of accessing financial information. It was here I first realised how much effort goes into securing the digital world against often very vulnerable internet users. This is often overlooked and underrated. 

At the time I didn't realise it, but during my MSc in Forensic Psychology, i was applying the same analytical mindset within research and statistic modules. I had learned to analyse human behaviour, predict actions and assess risk. The general theme here was spotting anomalies, and I believe this directly translates into cybersecurity. As I seek futher educative resources into cybersecurity, I begin to understand much of it is rooted in data analysis and taking swift action against threats and weaknesses in software.
