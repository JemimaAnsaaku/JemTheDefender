# Linux Intro - Lesson 1: Basic Commands


The Linux command line (also known as the terminal or shell) allows users to interact with the system using text-based commands. Mastering basic commands is the first step toward becoming proficient in Linux.

### Basic Navigation Commands

### a) pwd â€“ Print Working Directory

The pwd command displays the current directory you are in.

Useful when navigating through the Linux file system to avoid getting lost.

Example:

input example
```
pwd
```

Output Example:
```
/home/user/Documents
```
### Ls - listing files and directories 

ls shows what's inside the current folder. It lists files and subfolders.

Why itâ€™s useful:

Lets you see what files and folders exist.

Helps you find the file or folder you want to work with.

More options:

ls -l â†’ Show detailed info (permissions, size, etc.).

ls -a â†’ Show hidden files (files that start with .).

input example 

```
ls
```

output example 

```
file1.txt  file2.txt  Pictures  Downloads
```

### 3. cd â€“ Change Directory

What it does:

cd lets you move between folders.

```
cd foldername
```
Moves into foldername.

```
cd Pictures
pwd
```

output 
```
home/user/pictures
```

cd goes into the pictures directory and then pwd prints the working directory to show you the location of the file. 

.. means go uo to the parent folder 

input

```
cd ..
pwd
```

output 
```
home/user
```

you can also go straight to a specific folder using cd

```
cd /home/user/downloads
```

### 4. cat â€“ View File Contents

What it does:

cat lets you see whatâ€™s inside a file. It prints the fileâ€™s content directly in the terminal.

input 
```
cat file1.txt
```
output (if file1.txt contanins text 

```
Hello, this is a test file.
```

ðŸ’¡ Now you can read the fileâ€™s content without opening an editor.

ðŸ“Œ Why cat is useful:

Quickly check whatâ€™s inside a file.

Combine multiple files into one (cat file1 file2 > merged.txt).

## Using Find 

The find command is fantastic in a way that it can be used both very simply or rather complex depeonding on what it is you want to do exactly. 

lets start simple and assume we already know the name of the file we are looking for but cant remember where it is, in this case we are looking for passwords.txt

if we remember the filename, then we can simply use 

```
find -name passwords.txt
```
where the command will look through every folder in our current directory for that specific file 

output 
```
./folder1/passwords.txt
```
lets say we do not know the name of the dile, or want to search for every file that has an extension such as ".txt. - find lets us do that too 

we simply use what is known as a wildcard (*) to search for anything that has the .txt at the end. in this case, we want to find every .txt file that is in our current directory. We will construct a command 

```
find -name *.txt.
```
find has been able to find every .txt file and has then given us the location of each one 

output 

```
find -name *.txt
./folder1/passwords.txt
./documents/todo.txt
```
find has managed to find passwords.txt in Folder1

find has managed to find todo.txt in documents

## Using Grep 

The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for. 

for example, the access log of a web server, in this case, the access.log of a web server has 244 entries 

```
wc -l access.log
244 access.log
```

using a command like cat would not cut it here. lets say if we wanted to search this log file to see the things that a certain user/IP address visited? looking through 244 entries isnt all that efficient considering that we want to find a specific value 

we can use grep to search the entire contents of this file for any entries of the claue that we are searching for. going with the example of a web server's access log, we want to see everything that the ip address "81.143.211.90" has visited

```
grep "81.143.211.90" access.log
81.143.211.90 - - [25/mar/2021:11:17 + 0000] "GET / HTTP/1.tryhackme@linux1:~$
```
here grep has searched through this file and shown us any entries of what we have provided and that is contained within this log file for the ip

### summary of find cat and grep

grep â€“ Search Inside Files

ðŸ”¹ Purpose: grep is used to search for a specific pattern (word, phrase, or regex) inside files or output.

find â€“ Locate Files & Directories

ðŸ”¹ Purpose: find is used to search for files and directories in a filesystem based on name, size, date, permissions, etc..

cat â€“ Display File Content

ðŸ”¹ Purpose: cat is used to read or concatenate files (show their content). cat is just for reading files, not searching or finding them.

## Intro to shell operators 

linux operators are a fantastic way to power up your knowledge of working with linux. there are a few important operators that are worth nothing...

### operator & 

this operator allows us to execute commands in the background. For example, lets say we want to copy a large file. this will obviously take quite a long time and will leave us unable to do anything else until the file successfully copies. 

the & shell operator allows us to execute a command and have it run in the background, thus allowing us to do other things!

### operator &&

this shell operator can be used to make a list of commands to run for example comand1 &&  and command2 &&

it is worth noting that command2 will only run if command1 was successful

### operator >

this operator is whats known as an output redirector. this essentially means that we take the output from a command we run and send that output to somewhere else. 

a great example of redirection is redirecting thee output of the echo command. for example we could redirect an echo howdy, which would redirect howdy back to our terminal which isnt super useful. what we can do instead is redirect howdy to a new file.

so lets say we wanted to create a file named "welcome" with the message "howdy" we can run

```
echo howdy > welcome
```
then we can use cat to see the contents of the file welcome 

```
cat welcome
howdy
```
note, if the file "welcome" already exists, the contents will be overwritten.

## Operator ">>"

This operator is also an output redirector like > however, what makes this different is that rather than overwriting any contents within a file, it instead just puts the output at the end.

following on with our previous example where we have the file "welcome" and the contents of "howdy", if we were to use echo to add "hello" to the file using the > operator, the file will now only have "hello" and not "howdy" it would overwrite.

the >> operator allows to apend the output to the bottom of the file rather than replacing the contents 

```
echo "howdy gworls" >> hello
cat hello
howdy
howdy gworls
```
