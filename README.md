# JemTheDefender
Hi, I’m Jim! With a Master’s in Forensic Psychology and a Bachelor’s in Psychology, I’ve developed a deep understanding of research, data analysis, and critical thinking. I’m using these skills to dive into ethical hacking and security challenges, documenting my journey through TryHackMe rooms and personal projects.
