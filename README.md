The match for my interest in cybersecurity ignited in an unexpected place: as a Fraud Prevention Advisor at TSB Bank. Though I wasn’t building systems or managing networks, I served as something akin to a human firewall. When clients called in with blocked accounts, I had to verify their identities, analyze transaction histories, navigate Power of Attorney relationships, and use my intuition to stop scammers from accessing sensitive financial data. It was in this role that I first realized how essential an organized, hierarchical system of collaborative teams is in securing the digital world against cybercriminals. This ongoing battle, though often overlooked, is critical to our digital security.

At the time, I didn’t fully recognize it, but my MSc in Forensic Psychology was already training me in skills that directly align with cybersecurity. Through my research and statistical analysis modules, I developed a keen ability to analyze human behavior, predict actions, and assess risks. The core theme was identifying anomalies—something that directly translates to identifying threats in cybersecurity. As I dive deeper into cybersecurity education, I’m discovering that data analysis is at the heart of this field, and the ability to act swiftly to mitigate threats and weaknesses in systems is paramount.
